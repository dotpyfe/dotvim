" Maciek's vimrc
" current list of extensions I'm using:
"
" Pathogen: easy modular management of plugins
" Tagbar: Taglist++, source code browsing (requires exuberant-ctags pkg
"   >=v5.5) (currently mapped to <leader>1)
" SuperTab: Insert-mode tab completion
"	Surround: easy mappings for parens, brackets, quotes, etc (e.g. cs'" to
"	  change single quotes to double quotes
"	NERDTree: better file explorer, i.e. replaces :Ex and :Vex (mapped to
"   <leader>2)
"	NERDCommenter: easy mappings for inserting comments ('<leader>cc' etc in cmd mode to use)
"	Fugitive: git integration (e.g. :Gstatus)
"	Argtextobj: allows function arguments to be edited as vim text objects
"	Indenttextobj: allows text at same indent level to be edited as vim text
"	objects (particularly useful for, e.g., Python)
"	Grepvim: grep integration (use :Grep, among other things)
"	Bufexplorer: easy buffer navigation (just use <leader>be)
"	FuzzyFinder: search files, buffers, tags etc. (e.g. <leader>ff)
"   -> L9lib: required for FuF
" AutoloadCscope: forces Cscope to recurse up parent dirs to find the
"   database (build db with cscope -R -b, add -q to build inverted index for
"   quicker lookups, add -k when doing kernel/lib hacking to tell cscope to
"   ignore /usr/include)
" SnipMate: great for auto-completion of common tags,func templates etc
" AutoComplPop: pop-down menu for autocompletion

" set up pathogen for easy plugin installation and mgmt
call pathogen#runtime_append_all_bundles()
call pathogen#helptags()
